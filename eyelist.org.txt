Typical process in my comp:

1. Screen the port connecting to the edison: 
	*NB - THE A903BX30 IS UNIQUE TO MY MACHINE ONLY!

	screen /dev/cu.usbserial-A903BX30 115200 -L

2. Press enter twice and log in:
	username: root
	password: techytimo

2. Configure WiFi *only* and get the edison connected

	configure_edison --setup

3. Get to work. You can now log into the edison from anywhere else
	
	ssh root@192.168.20.147

	...the password is techytimo
